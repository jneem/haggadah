haggadah
========

This is a Haggadah, written using `lilypond`. To build it, you need `lilypond` and `lilypond-book` installed (it's tested with version 2.14). You'll also need `xelatex` installed. Edit the `build.sh` file to point to your installation of `lilypond` and `lilypond-book`, then run it. The output will appear in `out/haggadah.pdf`.
